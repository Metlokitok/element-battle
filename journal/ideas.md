# Ideas
Notes for ideas, fixes, features, etc.

## Features
- To be implemented:
   - Game menu
   - User input handling
   - Player vs Player
   - Player vs CPU
   - More Character types
   - Buff/Debuff durations, Magic Points (mp) system, Damage over time (DOT) system
   - Endless Mode
   - Level System for Endless Mode
   - Charge system
   - Damage calculation (for weakness, resistance)

## Self Notes
- Quick Note
    - buff/debuff and dots should be different class. This is to avoid buff/debuff stacking
    - The status effects happens on the player that was applied to, not applies status effects on another player
    - There needs to be a small documentation for how damage works, debuff types, element types, etc
        - Probably in the future updates

## Element Types and their playstyle (Draft)
- Fire
    - Strong against grass, weak against water
    - Can reduce enemy attack
    - Every attack has chance of inflicting "Burn" DoT
    - Ultimate deals great damage when target is under burn effect
